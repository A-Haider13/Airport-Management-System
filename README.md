# Final Project
 The data.py file contains the code that was used to produce randomized input.
 The input files have already been committed so running the data.py file is not necessary.
 The bruh.py file contains all the working code for the project.
 The path for reading the input has been set to default, so it may vary with the settings of your pc/text editor.
 You can then run the code.
